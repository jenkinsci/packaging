  To use this repository, run the following command:

  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    WARNING: The gpg key use to sign our packages has been updated on 16th of April 2020, therefore you need to reimport it if you imported before this date.
  </div>

  <pre class="text-white bg-dark">

  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/{{artifactName}}.repo {{ web_url }}/{{artifactName}}.repo
  sudo rpm --import {{ web_url }}/{{organization}}.key
  </pre>

  <p>
  If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the <code>rpm --import</code> will fail because
  you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.

  <pre class="text-white bg-dark">

  yum install {{artifactName}}
  </pre>
